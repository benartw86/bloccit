<!-- we iterate over each post in @posts. For each post we create a link with  post.title as the text that links to /posts/id, with the id from the post.id 
Instance variables created in a controller method are available in its associated view.  
Since we create and assign @posts in PostsController#index, we can use it in the posts index view.

If we call link_to with the object to which we're linking as a second argument, the  link_to method will detect the object, parse its id, and create the path using the id
